Papa's Tops Pizza has requested for an overhaul of their current website as they want to embrace some of the latest UX design and ensure the website has a modern feel where the users will enjoy a better shopping experience.  

Whilst pizza will remain as the core product for sale, it's clear in todays highly competetive market place that the business owner needs to improve their marketing and deal proposition to the end user. Whilst a quality pizza product is a given, the user wants to be delighted with deals that generates a feeling of good value.   Whats not to like about whiskey? This website is built for the whiskey connoisseur who enjoys the finer things in life, like minded consumers give their feedback on premium products and opportunities to purchase whiskey at discounted prices.

The user experience centres upon signing up to an incentive based web design and the user is able to click on link buttons to access more feature information, special membership and rapid ordering through auto-mated dialling or email ordering.

### index.html
**Navbar** has been designed to include an icon image that can be toggled to both reveal and close the navbar. The 'home' icon allows the user to return to the homepage / top of the screen. In addition, the 'menu & ordering' icon is a placeholder for the next phase of developemnt to connect the user to the full pizza menu, with capability to order.

'Contact Us' icon is another portal to a modal window that enables the user view the companies location, address, telephone number, email address and opening hours. Furthermore, the user is able to call & email the company direct from this app modal window  

A hero image of a pizza chef greets the user with an invitation to enter their postcode & click the **order** button to initiate the ordering process

## Tests
A user [testing matrix](https://github.com/Spagettileg/new-papas-tops-pizza/blob/main/testing/UserTestingPapasTopsPizzav1final.zip) has been produced in MS Excel, but saved as .pdf to visualize here on GitHub. It outlines the various tests I made to ensure the site renders consistently across different platforms, and that each functionality behaves as intended.
